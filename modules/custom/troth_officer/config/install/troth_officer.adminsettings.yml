The current Shope is Ben Waggoner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Troth publishes a quarterly journal,&nbsp;<em>Idunna</em>, which is sent to all members of the Troth as well as a few non-member subscribers; back issues are made available to the general public. The current editor of&nbsp;<em>Idunna</em>&nbsp;is Diana Paxson, assisted by Lorrie Wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Troth also publishes a large and growing line of books of interest to Heathens and others interested in Norse and Germanic religion. These include&nbsp;<em>Our Troth</em>(2 vols.), the most comprehensive guide ever published to ancient and modern Heathen practice;&nbsp;<em>A Book of Blots</em>, a collection of over fifty rituals for honoring the Gods of the North, with essays on effective worship; and a growing series of original translations of Old Norse sagas, many of which are hard to find in translation anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, the Troth has begun making most of these publications available in various electronic formats, as well as in print. The Shope's Office also oversees the production and sale of merchandise such as patches and T-shirts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shope's Office can always use volunteers. All of the content of&nbsp;<em>Idunna</em>&nbsp;is written by members and friends of the Troth. We publish everything from scholarly articles to personal essays, interviews, short fiction, poetry, and artwork. Each&nbsp;<em>Idunna</em>&nbsp;issue is grouped around a theme; contact the Shope for the current upcoming themes. We can also use contributors for various books and other publishing projects that the Troth sponsors, as well as people with skills in editing, proofreading, and graphic design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and if you're curious about the title. . . it is a modernization of the Old English word&nbsp;<em>scop</em>. Related to modern English \"shape\", a&nbsp;<em>scop</em>&nbsp;was a shaper of words-a poet, singer, and tale-teller at a ruler's court. While the current Shope is not as skilled at harping and improvising alliterative verse as a&nbsp;<em>scop</em>&nbsp;of old, he and his fellows are nonetheless shapers of words, in service to the Gods and to the Heathen community.</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:10:\"basic_html\";}s:7:\"archive\";i:0;s:6:\"delete\";i:0;}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"name\";s:8:\"Stewards\";s:9:\"shortname\";s:8:\"stewards\";s:11:\"description\";a:2:{s:5:\"value\";s:180:\"<p>The people that are local and regional to you are called Stewards, and you may reach out to them if you have any questions, or are looking for local groups and activities.</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:10:\"basic_html\";}s:7:\"archive\";i:0;s:6:\"delete\";i:0;}i:7;a:5:{s:4:\"name\";s:6:\"Elders\";s:9:\"shortname\";s:6:\"elders\";s:11:\"description\";a:2:{s:5:\"value\";s:1070:\"<p>Since its inception, The Troth has recognized certain people as Elders. The exact criteria over three decades has changed, but what has not changed is the general notion of spotlighting certain individuals for significant contributions to the organization and to the wider Heathen community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of June 2019, the High Rede has clarified the concept of Elder. At a bare minimum, an Elder is someone who has served the organization for a decade in a titled position, and has established a significant rapport with the membership. But more so, an Elder should be construed as someone whose workings have shaped The Troth in a definitive manner. In so many words, an Elder is an individual whose words and deeds have helped define and ennoble The Trothâ€™s Inner-Yard. They have established a legacy worthy of respect and inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elders have set an example of service to the membership. They are expected to share their knowledge and experience with the High Rede and membership when asked to do so.
